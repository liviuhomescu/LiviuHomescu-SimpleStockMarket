
This is a Spring web project developed in Intellij 13 adn build with Gradle.

As requested in the assignment pdf, all data is stored in memory.

The list of trades and the map of stocks are both in "StockMarketUtils"

For testing, I have created 2 Spring profiles, "production" and "test".

Activating a profile is done by using the following VM option "-Dspring.profiles.active="production,test".

An example link used to add a trade is "http://localhost:8080/LiviuHomescu-SimpleStockMarket/addTrade.htm/executionTimestamp=03-04-2016:04:30&numberOfShares=20&buyOrSell=sell&tradePrice=6.2"

Since it was not included in the requirements, there is no link for adding a stock. All stocks form the assigned homework asre staticly added.

The testing link : "http://localhost:8080/LiviuHomescu-SimpleStockMarket/functionalTests.htm" should not be available if  "-Dspring.profiles.active="production" is used.

The other type of tests ive created is the uni tests in folder "unittests".

Unit tests are used for detecting logical errors such as when there are no trades or when values are wrongly sent.

The testing link should be used to get users to approve the used formulas. This is a mor graphical way of showing users how the app will behave.

Currently the app is ready for user acceptance(UAT), not production.
